# Beginning-Machine-Learning

This repository is a collection of files that I used to start learning about machine learning. 
The majority of these files are tutorials that I followed from very helpful websites and YouTube Videos. 
I will do my best to link the source material for each of the tutorials in the individual files.


## How to Navigate this Repository

This repository uses folders to organize its contents. 
Each folder gives insights to its contents to help with making it easier to navigate the repositories. 
It is likely that there are folders within folders to further organize files.

### Base Folder

At the root of the repository is where you will find the first set of folders. 
These are divided into learning periods and Kaggle competitions. 

The learning periods are in chronological order of the groups of subjects I learned during each period. 
These include files about different machine learning techniques and methods mostly from following tutorials.

The Kaggle competition folder holds submissions made before I started using the Kaggle platform to write notebooks.

### File Naming

All notebooks follow a standard file naming convention.

  `Date created - File Title - Type of Contents`

**Sample File name:**

`YEAR.MONTH.DAY-File_Title-Method-Creator.ipynb`

#### Date Created

Date created is the date that the notebook was created. 
The formatting for this is:

  `YEAR.MONTH.DAY`

#### File Title

The title of the file is typically the first line the notebook using a Heading 1 font. 
Sometimes the title in the notebook is too long, so it is condensed to contain the most important parts. 
This helps reduce the length of file names while still conveying the contents of the notebook. 
The formatting for 

`Sample_File_Name`

#### Type of contents

This portion of the file name gives more specific information about the type of notebook the file is. 
This can designate if the notebook follows a website tutorial or a YouTube video, etc. 
Sometimes file names include multiple types like the specific website or channel that was used. 
A sample format is shown here:

`Method-Creator`


## Files

### Jupyter Notebooks

All code in this notebook is written using Jupyter Notebook. 

Jupyter Notebook allows the file to seamlessly switch between explanation and python code. 
This combination makes it easier to explain sections of the code with more customizable and easier to read text than the traditional python comments. 
The cell structure of Jupyter Notebboks also allows similar code to be grouped together for further clarity. 
A final benefit to using Jupyter notebooks is the ability to see output directly below the lines of code that caused the output. 
This is especially useful when working with dataframes and making predictions using machine learning models.

### .csv

Many other files in this repository are of type "Comma Separated Values" (.csv). 
This is common for machine learning since these file types can be used to make dataframes using Pandas.

Because most of this repository was created from following tutorials, the names of most .csv files are the names given by the original creators. 
These names are kept to ensuure that the notebook runs as intented.
